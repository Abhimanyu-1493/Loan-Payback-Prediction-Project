# Loan-Payback-Prediction-Project
Performed data wrangling using Python, adjusted for missing values, identified and dealt with outliers and anomalies using exploratory data analysis.  Constructed Artificial Neural Networks model using Tensorflow, forecasting classification variables like Loan Repaid = Yes or No. Predicted most important features in determination of the classification variable, and evaluated the model using confusion matrix, Recall and F-statistics.
